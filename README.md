# ChromeDecrypter
A small GUI that can be used to decrypt a Google Chrome login data file.
This tool is intended to be used in combination with the ``ChromePasswords`` script found in my BadUsb repository.




## How to use?

```bash
  1. Download the .rar file from the latest release
  2. Extract the folder
  3. Install the requirements.txt file
  4. Open the ChromeDecrypter.py file
  5. You're ready to go!
```




## IMPORTANT!

Please do not delete the ``var.txt`` file, it's used for passing variables between the scripts. Thanks.
